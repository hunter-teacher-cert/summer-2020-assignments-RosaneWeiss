Answer 1:
The output is:

No,I wug.
You wugga wugwug.
I wug.


explanation:
1-First the main methid is executed. 
2 - It will print "No,I " and then call method zoop.
3 - method zoop is executed and it will call method baffle.
4 -method baffled is executed and it prints "wug" - same line .
Then it will call method ping.
5 - Method ping will print "." and then go to next line. 
Then method ping ends and controls get back to method baffle, which called ping.
Method Ping was executed, so it goes to the next statement on zoop
6 - Back in zoop, it prints "You wugga" and do the whole sequence for baffle again. 
so it prints "wug" and repeats steps 4-5, which prints "wug."
7 - zoop has no more commands, so control is returned to methid main .
8 -Method main then prints "I " then calles method baffle again
9 - method baffle repeates 4 - and prints "wug."

Answer 2: 
state of the program is what is being printed, I guess.
At the first time ping is invoked, we completed 1-4 above
So it will be printed

No. I wug


Answer 3:
If we invoke baffle at the end of ping, the program will be in an infinite loop.
ping will call baffle that will call ping that will call baffle and it will keep going forever , to infinity and beyond!!!
