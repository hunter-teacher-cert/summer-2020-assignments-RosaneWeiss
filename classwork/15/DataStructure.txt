public class Person {


/*
I would create a 3D array, where 
	the first index is the first level of last name,
	th second index is the second level, in case the first colide
	the third is the first name and phone number
	

public class person {
  private String lastName;
  private String firstName;
  private String phoneNumber;
  
  // other members not shown
} 

public class PhoneBook{
	int [][][] Phone = new PhoneBook
}

if we use

String s = "ABC";
int i = s.charAt(0);

Therefore, if you do
String lastName = "Weiss";
int i = lastName.charAt(0);
so forthe first index, add the value for each character by doing a loop till the end of the string. 
	Then find the module sum%73(or any prime number (They hold more remainders). 
	If it collide, use the same sum but with another prime nmber, 67. That should give a unique combination (I hope)
	Then use the same technique for the first name and put the first name and the phone number in the same cell.(If I need
		to search by phone number I would create a new array with the 3indexes and the phone number, manipulating the indexed somehow to get smaller 
		but still keeping the otiginal one so I can get to the original name array)
	
1)The add will have 3 calculations, and if there is no colision, second index will be 0.
2)Since the last name is unique, you can access it in 3 operations.
3) Remove will get zeros to the array.
4) list will need to go through it but skip if index1's data is zeros

I am sure there is a bunch of unforseen problems with this thought because it seems too easy.....

If I would need a reverse by phne number, I would put the phone number in another array and use the indexes 1,2 and 3 in combination to find it. 
add. multiple, etc and take modulus? I would save the phone number and the 3 indexes (like 346630) followed by the phone number. 
Once I find he phonenumber, the indexes will guide me to the right position on the 3D table. Yes, it will take FOREVER!!!!
